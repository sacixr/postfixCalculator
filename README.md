# Infix and Reverse Polish Calculator

## Description
This project is a very basic calculator application using a user-friendly, text-based interface, done as part of my CS2800 University Coursework. It is designed to perform arithmetic calculations of any size using two different notation systems: infix and postfix, with an additional ability to store values under String-based names. It is important to emphasize that the replication and misattribution of this project, as well as its duplication with subsequent modifications, are strictly prohibited.

## Installation
To install the project, simply clone this project into a directory of your choice. Once completed, run the CalcMain file, which should start up the program.

## Features
- Infix Calculator: The calculator supports standard infix notation, allowing users to input expressions like (4 + 5) * (6 + 7) and obtain the corresponding results.
- Postfix Calculator: The application also includes a postfix calculator, enabling users to perform calculations using reverse polish notation. For example, entering 4 5 + 6 7 + * would yield the same result as the infix expression.
- Stored Values: Users have the option to store values during their calculations, providing a convenient way to reuse or reference these values in subsequent calculations.
- Exit Functionality: The program includes an option for users to exit the calculator application.
